## Agenda 

**Mandatory items:**

- working groups,

**Additional items raised:**

- Maintainers, need new hands (Jarkko continues, Jussi stepping down)
- ODPS landing page has been refreshed by Jarkko

## Roadmap proposal
Version 3.1. before end of the year 2024. To include:

- Pricing Plans as code. Support for Stripe and built-in neutral approach
- Add neutral as code options to DQ and SLA as well.
- In the above try to find a unified model that can be used in all three. 

## Project practices proposals

- Do we need to have fixed recurring online meetings to discuss features?
- Do we need slack or alike? 

## Subgroups proposals

## Working group proposals

- Retire Business Advisory Group, no activity for long time. Only one talking almost in all is maintainer. Apparently not providing enough value
- Before retiring, ask group participants if there is willingness to lead it and activate again.
