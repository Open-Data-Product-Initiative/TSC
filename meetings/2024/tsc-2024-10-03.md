- Do we need slack or alike?

**Decisions:**
- none

## Subgroups proposals

**Decisions:**
- none

## Working group proposals

- Retire Business Advisory Group, no activity for long time. Only one talking almost in all is maintainer. Apparently not providing enough value
- Before retiring, ask group participants if there is a willingness to lead it and activate again.

**Decisions:**
- ask business advisory channel if it is needed anymore. Arrange voting in the channel to close or keep it.
- Wait votes for 7 days, if no votes, notify all it will be retired. If even one wants to keep it, then it stays
