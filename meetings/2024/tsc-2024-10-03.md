# Open Data Product Specification TSC meeting 3rd Octorber 2024, 8pm UAE time (on Google meets)

## Agenda 

**Mandatory items:**

- Review roadmap,
- project practices,
- needed subgroups,
- working groups,

**Additional items raised:**

- Maintainers, need new hands (Jarkko continues, Jussi stepping down)

## Roadmap proposal
Version 3.1. before end of the year 2024. To include:

- Pricing Plans as code. Support for Stripe and built-in neutral apporach
- Add neutral as code options to DQ and SLA as well.
- In the above try to find unified model that can be used in all three. 

## Project practices proposals

- Do we need to have fixed recurring online meetings to discuss features? 

## Subgroups proposals

## Working group proposals

- Retire Business Advisory Group, no activity for long. Only one talking almost in all is maintainer. Apparently not providing enough value
