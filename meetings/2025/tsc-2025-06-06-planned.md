### 1. Discussion forum - Slack or something else
- Slack
- Discord
- Question is that who takes some responsibility of it. I kind of find it hard to believe that it just rolls on its own, but I might be wrong (Jarkko). Setting up a chat env hardly is enough to ignite discussions and interaction. 
- What is the primary problem we want to solve with discussion forum and how would it solve it?
- Some say that current WA is good enough
- Some say that we need more than WA
- We need to minimize the amount of communication channels, that we all agree due to limited people involved and other reasons
- If Slack is taken into use, WA is paused for agreed time to test Slack approach.
- Slack or Discord?
  

**Decision:**

- Discord
- Piloting, can be stopped anytime by TSC if needed
- Pause WA after all have access to Discord
- Learn patterns how to organize topics and management, document learnings
- Initial channels: Tools dev, TSC meetings, Next Release, Partnerships (a lot of this kind of topics ongoing by Jarkko), Issues (integration from Github?), Welcome (with community guidelines)

**Next steps:**

- Zaher starts setting up.
- Provide link to group in WA for review when ready

### 2. Entering incubation phase in Linux Foundation

- We need a sponsor, other requirements are most likely negotiable.

**Decision:**
  
**Next steps:**

- Jarkko to discuss with LF about the requirements, how could we proceed to next step

<hr/>

### 3. Data Mesh spec (port orientation) and how to merge that with ODPS 
- Some users of ODPS are struggling with this. Not one but more, so perhaps we can start drafting patterns for the hybrids.
- We already have a hybrid in X-Road, but that is OpenAPI spec & ODPS
- Output ports are a bit like or related to Access in ODPS
- Kruger meeting Sat around the same topic
- Topic related to Open Data Product Specification, Data Product Descriptor (Data Mesh), Open Data Contract Standard (leaning towards Data Mesh)
- Idea exchange for solutions 

### 4. Webinar
- Maintainer has suggested that we organize a use cases focused webinar.
- BASF, Alation, X-Road and one more to showcase briefly how they use ODPS
- What is the first audience to approach: 
- Requires a lot of collaboration between stakeholders before can be done
- This might need to be thought of as a recurring event, not always just business use cases, but progress, tooling show cases, etc.
- Create a roadmap of events and leave spots open for example for BASF, Alation, X-Road, FIWARE case far in the future
- Takes effort

**Decision:**

**Next steps:**

- On hold, Jarkko gives a little time for this

**Decision:**
- Proposal: approach accepted for next ODPS version 

**Next steps:**
- Proposal: Maintainers prepare the RC for review

### 6. Opportunities and partnerships

- NATO adopted ODPS (just discovered this recently online)
- Alation has publicly announced using ODPS in data product agent tool, testimonial asked in email, no response yet (Jarkko)
- Kruger (CA): notes on some issues in adoption coming soon, Jarkko to review and see how to assist Kruger, meeting Sat 7th June (Jarkko)
- Amtrak: No news, very sluggish progress (Jarkko)
- The Modern Data Company: new start of discussion, meeting coming with CMO and others (Jarkko)
- ODPS raised to the awareness of Open Data Institute, suggested further discussions with their internal standardization focused staff. (Jarkko)
- Soda.io connection created. Suggested collaboration (Jarkko)

**Decision:**

**Next steps:**

### 7. Training materials and Courses
- New Data Product Monetization MasterClass (commercial) in Udemy. ODPS is very heavily used and includes guidance how to use it in AI Agent ready data product monetization https://www.udemy.com/course/data-product-monetization-masterclass/
- Already earlier Data Product MasterClass was published in Udemy. ODPS also has a role in it. https://www.udemy.com/course/data-product-mindset/

<hr/>

### 8. Certification program 
- Suggested that Data Maestro Academy take action and lead on a certification program with free learning materials. https://github.com/Open-Data-Product-Initiative/TSC/blob/main/docs/certfication.md 

**Decision:**
- Proposal: Data Maestro Academy to draft the model with details for TSC approval. Later, create a Certification Board (ODPS Core + community reps) to oversee the certification. 

**Next steps:**

### 9. AI integration and chatbot development

Many organizations adopting data products now face a dilemma: they aim to align with data mesh principles while still wanting to leverage key features of the Open Data Product Specification (ODPS). What’s needed are clear patterns for building hybrid models that combine the best of both worlds.

### 10. Tools Development, CLI, GUI

- In group a discussion of tools development need. Jorge amont others
- X-road context
