### 1. Discussion forum - Slack or something else
- Slack
- Discord

-  Question is that who takes some responsibility of it. I kind of find it hard to believe that it just rolls on its own, but I might be wrong (Jarkko). Setting up a chat env hardly is enough to ignite discussions and interaction. 
- What is the primary problem we want to solve with discussion forum and how would it solve it?
