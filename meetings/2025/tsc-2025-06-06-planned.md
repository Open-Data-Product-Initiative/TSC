### 1. Discussion forum - Slack or something else
- Slack
- Discord

-  Question is that who takes some responsibility of it. I kind of find it hard to believe that it just rolls on its own, but I might be wrong (Jarkko). Setting up a chat env hardly is enough to ignite discussions and interaction. 
- What is the primary problem we want to solve with discussion forum and how would it solve it?

### 3. Data Mesh spec (port orientation) and how to merge that with ODPS 
- Some users of ODPS struggling with this. Not one but more, so perhaps we can start drafting patterns for the hybrids.
- We already have hybrid in X-Road but that is OpenAPI spec & ODPS

### 4. Webinar
- Maintainer has suggested that we organize a use cases focused webinar.
- BASF, Alation and one more to showcase briefly how they use ODPS

### 9. AI integration and chatbot development

Many organizations adopting data products now face a dilemma: they aim to align with data mesh principles while still wanting to leverage key features of the Open Data Product Specification (ODPS). What’s needed are clear patterns for building hybrid models that combine the best of both worlds.

### 10. Tools Development, CLI, GUI
