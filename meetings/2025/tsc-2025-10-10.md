## 3. Proposed addition to coming ODPS 4.1 – Data Product connection to business strategy

Maintainer proposing RC for next ODPS https://opendataproducts.org/v4.1rc/ If agreed it can be published for commenting and community review for 2 weeks. If during that time no unresolvable issues arise, it will become production release 4.1. 

The Release Candidate (RC) of the Open Data Product Specification (ODPS) introduces a simple but powerful addition: the productStrategy element. This change moves ODPS beyond describing the technical details of a data product. It makes it possible to explain the business purpose of a data product in clear terms.

**What is productStrategy?
**

At its core, productStrategy helps answer four questions every executive cares about:

* Why does this data product exist? (objectives)
* How does it support the company’s strategy? (strategic alignment)
* Which business KPIs does it contribute to? (outcomes)
* How do we measure its own performance? (product-level KPIs)

Think of it as the missing link between the work of the data team and the scorecard of the leadership team.
